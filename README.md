## Todo App built using react

1. add todo
2. display todos
3. complete todo
4. show number of active todos
5. filter all/active/complete
6. delete todo
7. delete all complete (only show if at least one is complete)
8. toggle all on/off
9. save todos to localstorage (so the user will not lose data)
